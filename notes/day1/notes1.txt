What is intellilgence?
	- the ability to make a decision on your own, and to adapt based on input

What is AIs goal?
	- Understand what goes on around him, and achieve Autonomy

What is AI?
	- 2 axis
		- thought processes and reasoning
		- behaviour

Acting Humanly:
	- Turing Test Approach
		- A computer passes this test if a human interrogator after posing written questions gets written answers that they cannot distinguish from human responses
		- To pass this test:
			- Natural language processing
				- Allows for communication through language
			- Knowledge representation
				- Encode the data in a meaningful way in order to process it
			- Automatic reasoning:
				- Use that stored info to answers questions and draw consclusions
			- Machine learning:
				- To adapt to new circumstances

The Total Turing Test is an extension of the turing test:
	- It includes video signal to test perceptual abilities and the ability to interact with objects
	- Requires:
		- Computer Vision
			- Recongnize objects
		- Robotics:
			- Interact with objects

~~~~~

Thinking Humanly: | Cognitive modeling approach
	- How do you determine how humans work?
		- Brain Imaging
		- Human actions(through psycological experiences)

	- Translate that info into a program

	- Cognitive Science
		- Combines computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psycology to construct precise theories of the human mind

~~~~~~

Thinking Rationally:
	- "Laws of thought" approach
	- Field of Logic
	- Using precise notation for statements about all kinds of objects in the world and thei relations among them.
	- In theory, this approach can be used to SOLVE ANY SOLVABLE PROBLEMS -> it is possible in theory but it isn't practical.
	- Obstacles
		- Principle VS Practice
		- Difficulty in translating informal knowledge into formal knowledge

~~~~

Acting Rationally:
	- The rational agent approach
	- Agent: Something that acts
- Computer Agent:
	- Operate autonomously
	- Perceive the environment
	- Persist over a prolonged period of time
	- Be able to adapt to change
	- Create and pursuit goals

- Ration Agent:
	- An agent that acts in a way to achieve the best outcome or the best expected outcome in face of uncertainty

- Comparison to other approaches
	- More general than "Laws of thought"
	- More well defined thatn the other human approaches

Limited rationality VS perfect rationality

Foundations of AI
- Philosophy
- Mathematics
- Economics
- Neuroscience
- Psycology
- Computer Engineering
- Control theory & cybernetics
- Linguistics

Philosophy
	- How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
	- The connection between the mind and the body

Mathematics
	- What can be computed?
	- Hilbert's 23 problems, Godel's incompleteness theorem
	- Halting Problem
	- NP-completeness
		- Category of problems that are difficult to solve in a reasonable amount of time
	- Probablity
	- Economics
		- How should we make decisions to maximize profits?
		- Decision Theory, Game Theory

Neuroscience
	- How do brains process information?
	- Neural Networks
	- Neurons(nerve cells)
	- Broca's area (region of brain for speech production)

Even with a computer with infinite resources, we still would not know how to achieve brain's level of intellilgence


Psycology
	- How do humans and animals think and act?
	- Behaviour vs cognitive psiclogy
		- Results of experiments based on actions
		- Computer modelling of memory, language, and logical thinking

Computer Engineering
	- How can we build an efficient computer?

Control Theory and Cybernetics
	- How can artifacts operate under their own control
	- Designing Algorithms w/ objective functions to determine optimal actions

Linguistics
	- How does language relate to thought?
	- Natural Language processing
	- Knowledge representation
	- Natural language vs programming language

History of AI
	- The gestation of AI(1943 - 1955)
	- The birth of AI(1956)
	- 1952 - 1969 ( Early enthusiasm, great expectations )
	- 1966 - 1973 ( Difficulties encountered, a dose of reality )
	- 1980 - present ( AI becomes and industry )
	- 1987 - present ( AI adopts scientific method )
	- 2001 - present ( Availability of large data sets )
