Post Correspondance Problem

You are given a collection of dominoes.
Each domino has a string on the top and bottom.
You have unlimited copies of each domino.

The goal is to choose a sequence of dominoes such that the top and bottom strings match.


1 use bfs for the frontier
2 


store the difference between top and bottom, if there is no difference they match

only add to your frontier if you haven't seen the state before


INPUT:
	- Maximum size of the frontier used in bfs
	- Value of some kind of parameter (max depth) - the program could become infinite
	- Set of dominoes
	- A flag indicating the type of output

OUTPUT: (on of these 3)
	- A sequence of dominoes that solves the problem
	- A flag indicating that no solution exists
	- A flag indicating that no solution exists within the limits of your search
