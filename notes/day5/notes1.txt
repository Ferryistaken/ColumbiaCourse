In order to use search to beat a human in a chess game you couldn't use a blind search tree, because the goal state is too deep in the tree

Because of this the algorithm has to use an utility function which tells him which state would be the best inside of boundaries

it uses hill climbing -> more optmitized for this

search with adversaries is called "adversarial search"
